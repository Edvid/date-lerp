# Simple Date lerper

A simple site I created out of boredom before I had set up Internet in my new apartment and was running low on data from hotspot usage. I wanted to keep track of how much data I was allowed to use when, given I could only afford buying more data so-and-so often. 

This site has more applications than that ofc. It's a site for whenever you want to check if you're over or under some target value, given what time it is.

# How to use

Pick a start date and a start value. Whichever thing you're tracking, this is the value you know it had at the time of the picked date.

Pick a end date and an end value. This is the value you are aiming for, at the time of the end date picked.

To see if you're on track, compare your real value to the one you see on the site.
